# Predicting Success for Kickstarter Projects
My data comes from https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/

In this project, I use various classification algorithms to predict whether or not a Kickstarter project is going to succeed or fail, and publish a Flask app on Heroku to demonstrate the usage of my model.
