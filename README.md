# Predicting Success for Kickstarter Projects #

My data comes from https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/

In this project, I used various classification algorithms such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes to predict whether or not a Kickstarter project is going to succeed or fail, and published a Flask app on Heroku to demonstrate the usage of my model.

The Main Analysis Flow Workbooks cover the flow of the analysis from the initial model selection, followed by the GridSearchCV for the top performing models and the evaluation of the top models on test data.

Model Exploration folder contains the initial look at the various types of models used in the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis Workbooks deal with the first looks at the data and feature engineering/manipulation.

Kickstarter App folder contains the Flask app which can be found here:
